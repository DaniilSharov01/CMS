				<h2>Creating and managing content with a CMS</h2>
				<p>Once your CMS is set up, you can create and manage website content. Here are some best practices to ensure effective content management:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Plan your content</strong>: Develop a content strategy and plan your content in advance. This helps maintain consistency, relevancy, and a steady flow of information on your website.</li>
					<li><strong>Use a consistent structure</strong>: Ensure your content follows a consistent structure and formatting. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and paragraphs to make it visually appealing and easy to read.</li>
					<li><strong>Optimize for SEO</strong>: Take advantage of your CMS's SEO features. Use relevant keywords, meta tags, alt tags for images, and create descriptive URLs to improve your website's visibility in search engine results. The CMS taxonomy is also a good way to organize your site content with categories and tags.</li>
					<li><strong>Regularly update and maintain content</strong>: Keep your content up to date and relevant. Regularly review and update existing content to reflect the latest information and trends. Remove outdated or irrelevant content to maintain a fresh and engaging website. Most CMS have views of plugins to let you know when your content was last updated. Regularly updated content is crucial for ranking well on the search engines.</li>
					<li><strong>Backup your content</strong>: Regularly backup your website's content to prevent data loss. This ensures that you can easily restore your website in case of technical issues or accidental deletions. A good hosting partner will make regular backups of your site that will allow for quick restores if problems arise.</li>
