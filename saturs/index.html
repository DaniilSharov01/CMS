         <h2> What is a CMS and why is it important?</h2>
         <p>A CMS is a powerful tool that simplifies managing content on a website. It allows users to create, edit, and publish content without coding or technical expertise. This means that even individuals with limited technical knowledge can easily manage their website's content.
            CMS is important for its ability to streamline content management. It offers a centralized platform where users can create, organize, and publish content, making it easier to manage large amounts of information. This saves time and effort but also ensures consistency and accuracy across the website.
            Furthermore, a CMS allows multiple users to collaborate on content creation and management. This is particularly useful for businesses with multiple content creators or remote teams. It provides a secure and efficient way to work together, ensuring everyone has access to the latest version of content.
